# Insurance Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict insurance premiums based on customer demographics and risk factors. By analyzing variables such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region, the model helps identify key drivers of insurance costs and provides accurate premium predictions.

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Regression modeling using **Scikit-learn**
- Performance evaluation with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score
- End-to-end pipeline implementation in Python

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Import dataset containing customer demographics and insurance charges.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Clean and transform data for modeling.  
3. **EDA** – Visualize relationships between variables and insurance costs.  
4. **Modeling** – Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
5. **Evaluation** – Compare models using regression metrics.  
6. **Insights** – Identify key variables influencing insurance premiums.  

## 🚀 Results
- Built regression models that accurately predict insurance charges.  
- Identified significant factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.  
- Provided actionable insights for pricing strategies and risk assessment.
